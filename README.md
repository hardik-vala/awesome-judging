# Awesome Judging

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of opportunities to judge your peers if you're a dev. Serving as a judge or reviewer for any of the following competitions should help you qualify for the judging requirement of the US O-1A visa / EB-1 green card. But in this case, make sure that you're going to be (1) evaluating other *professionals* in *your field* (e.g. college hackathons don't count), and (2) your opinion is used to influence which participants win.

**DISCLAIMER**: This list is for informational purposes only and should not be considered legal advice. Serving as a judge for these opportunities does not guarantee qualification for any visa or immigration benefit. Immigration requirements can change, and individual cases vary significantly. Always consult with a qualified immigration attorney for advice specific to your situation. The maintainers of this list make no representations about the immigration benefits of these judging opportunities.
